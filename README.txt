fiepipe
By Bradley Friedman, FIE LLC

fiepipe is a set of scripts and libraries meant to be a pipeline/workflow
system for people and legal entities to organize both complex and simple
computer systems and networks.

It has its roots in the world of digital visual effects (VFX) and
animation as practiced at companies large and small through the late
1990s through the mid 2010s.

However, it is not simply for those industries.  Rather, it is an abstraction
and refactoring of general digital asset workflows.  As more and more work
becomes digital (not physical) in nature, the work de-facto becomes
digital asset workflow managed.

Therefore, all the best practices of working in digital VFX and animation
become relevant.  And therefore fiepipe becomes relevant.
